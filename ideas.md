Hackday ideas
=============
The weekend of 4th May.

Gitlactica
----------
Git + spaceships + shaders https://github.com/carlmw/gitlactica

Plinked
-------
Draw Something + Instagram + Dixit online game

Jource
------
Web version of Gource using d3 https://github.com/kevindmorgan/jource.

Non-boardgame game with boardgame mechanics
-------------------------------------------
Dinosaurs vs Ninjas (name ripped off from a Potato idea)
A top-down, turn-baserd asynchronous shooter reminiscent of Frozen Synapse and Space Hulk. One player controls the ninjas much like Frozen Synapse and one player controls a dinosaur (who shoots ninjas) but plays in real time.

Online portfolio
----------------
Something showing who we are, what we do and generally how awesome we are.

Lunchtime food ordering
-----------------------
A food ordering system for lunches that takes what local vendors are selling (probably by screen scraping) and allows you to order. Also exposing this data as an API for others to use. Someone at Potato is probably already working on this but would be nice to have an API.

Local shop price list
---------------------
A hyper local crowd sourced (if I can get in game mechanics I win at wanker bingo) listing of local shop prices. I believe this was Ben's idea from when we were at Hogarth.

Train locator
-------------
A mobile app for telling you where you are on your current train and estimated time for the next stations. You can sort of do this with things like thetrainline but this would use your location to work out what train you are on and deliver a very simple view of the upcoming stations and what times you would arrive at them.

Real-time comic book creator
----------------------------
Generates a comic book based off of a particular hashtag from Instagram and Twitter. Tweets will be put into speech bubbles of pre-taken photos, instagrams will just be panels. The photos will be stylised to look like comic drawings.

Game plays tracker
------------------
Similar to boardgame geeks play tracker but with more infographics and data analysis e.g. ELO rankings. Sort of Gamecenter but for real life games.

Exoplanets
----------
They're cool and we could do some fun visualisation of recent discoveries or something.

GIFBank
-------
I have too many gifs and need to organise them. Would be great to be able to tweet them easily.

Am I grumpy?
------------
Sentiment analysis of twitter accounts to see how grumpy you are.

Number of days since...
-----------------------
Small app iPad/web that allows you to display "Number of days since last [num]". Plugin for CI. http://www.london-electronics.com/rockwood_small.gif.

The Picard Project
------------------
Using face detection generate gifs of scenes from the entire run of ST:TNG featuring Captain Picard.

Put them on the internet. Become legends.

Things to do while running tests
--------------------------------
One of those sites like whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner that gives a random suggestion for an activity to perform while waiting for tests to finish... no wait, there are other things you can do. Seriously, grow up.
